## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS grid layout
- Flexbox
- Scss
- TailwindCss
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Using Tailwind CSS has made it more convenient to build my projects, although I spent some time getting used to it. Additionally, my understanding of basic JavaScript concepts is still lacking, so I really need to practice more with JavaScript. I also want to thank another colleague from Front-End Mentor for introducing me to the BEM CSS methodology, which has been helpful in structuring my CSS.

### Continued development

I want to become more familiar with the tools I am using, so I will continue to practice in the future! I also plan to dedicate some time to practicing JavaScript.
